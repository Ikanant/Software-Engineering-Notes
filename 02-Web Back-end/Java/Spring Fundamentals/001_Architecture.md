Before Spring came around, JAVA web developers used various design patterns to allow us to write better code. Often JEE Blueprints. These blueprints helped us be consistent but often made our code brittle and untestable.

 

**WORA**: Write ONCE Run ANYWHERE

 

Sometimes we actually don\'t want the implementation of our application hardcoded. This is what SPRING architecture is going to help us with.

In the repo above I will start to setup a project (at first doing things manual by implementing service/repository layers) that will serve as an example to how to refactor things to use Spring
