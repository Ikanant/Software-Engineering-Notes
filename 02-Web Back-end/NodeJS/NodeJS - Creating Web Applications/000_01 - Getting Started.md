When inside our code, if we do some command like:

**var express = require (\'express\')**

Node has a built in package managing system that will take care of all of that... These package management system is called NPM

When writing our package.json file, each version for the packages we download will have a \^ symbol in front of it...this will tell Node that no matter what happens in the future, if there is any update for the version we have, it will update it.

There are two options here, either we do a \^ or a \~

\^: 4.13.1 It will update like 4.xx.x So any 4. something will get updated

\~: 4.13.1 It will update like 4.13.x
