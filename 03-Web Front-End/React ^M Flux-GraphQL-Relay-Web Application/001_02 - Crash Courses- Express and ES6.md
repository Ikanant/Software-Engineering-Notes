ES6 = The new and modern JavaScript

**Node and Express**

**Babel:**

This is NODE wrapped in Babel compiling that allows the full use of Most of ES6 features (and even some ES7)

**WebPack:**

When running webpack to create a bundle.js we can have to main flags

1.  -w: This flag will auto product another bundle.js if any of the .js files has been changed

2.  -d: Will create a bundle.js.map that will allow us to debug our code in the browser console

    a.  Example: instead of saying: problem at line \*\*\* in bundle.js..... It will point to our actual App.js
