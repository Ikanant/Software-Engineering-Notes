**What is Octopus Deploy?**

Octopus Deploy is a deployment automation tool that will allow us to update our application to the latest and greatest version while minimizing or eliminating down time.

**Agile**

-   Fast Iteration

-   Short Feedback Loop

-   Improvement of Business

**Manual Deployment**

Through FTP & COPY/PASTE all have one thing in common. Human intervention. In this environment, Humans become the weakest link. Repeating the exact same process over and over is not one of our strong suits.

-   Time Consuming

-   Repetitive

-   Boring

-   Error-prone

A common solution to this process is to create Deployment Manuals that describe the exact way to repeat this process. However, this solution often becomes out of sync and useless in any situation in the real world.

**Course Overview**

We will learn how to use Octopus Deploy to setup a

-   ASP.NET Web Application

-   Windows Services

**If we were to deploy an application manually:**

![Web Application - Copy files (FTP) - Start IIS web site and application pool - Configure correct permissions Windows Service - Log on to the remote machine - Stop the running service - Uninstall the service - Install the new service ](000_01_-_Introduction_000.png)

The first page we should familiarize ourselves with when using Octopus is the **Dashboard**. Through it we will be able to see every project we are managing as well as the state in which each application is running for all of our different environment.
