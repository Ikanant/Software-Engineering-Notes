We will be using Xamarin. Which is in essence C#. Knowledge of it is 100% required

The main idea for this course is to build an Android application by avoiding the \"Silo\'s\" approach for the development. The Silo\'s approach is one of the most common ways companies around the world tackle their various applications with the multi-platform issue. This means that company A might create first an application for iOS... then Android... and finally Windows.

Creating three different applications has it\'s own pros/cons. These types of applications are often extremely expensive. Companies have to dedicate individual development time for each while maintaining a consistent theme for their work. Multiple applications literally force the implementation of simple changes to be done THREE times.

One of the solutions to this problem is trying to identify the code that would run on all environments.... And the answer to that is HTML CSS and JS. So it is now very common for people to write applications using these \*website tools\* that will be functional all over the different environments. This solution brings another problem though: Native languages are always gonna be the right tools to truly enhance the experience of the applications. Without going into much detail, us developers need to keep in mind this handicap when creating applications that are in most cases gonna do \*workaround\* task to get the Operating System to comply properly to our commands.
