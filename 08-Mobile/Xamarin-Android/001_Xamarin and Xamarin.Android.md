Anyone that has developed for Android knows that the native language is JAVA. So, how come we currently use C# with Xamarin?

The framework we will use for the course is the Mono Framework. Mono is the open source version of the .NET framework. And it was actually created by the same people that created Xamarin. So the important thing to keep in mind is that working with Mono and working with regular .Net is nothing different. The namespaces and classes have the same structure. Now, on the other hand, using only .Net features will not allow use to write fully functional android applications.

Basically, Xamarin contains a wrapper implementation of native Android tools that we can talk to from our code. And in the end we end up with a REAL Android application

When we write an Android application with any of the available IDEs, we will be able to export regular APKs. Which we will use to install our application and various devices.
