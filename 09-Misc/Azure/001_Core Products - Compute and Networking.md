Azure Compute is a SET of services that provide on-demand computing power. It is NOT a service on itself... it is just a logical grouping of several services in Azure related to running application workloads.

 

Azure Compute Services are:

1.  Virtual Machines

    a.  Infrastructure as a Service offering. That gives you full control over the VMs

2.  Containers

    a.  Virtualized environments for running applications

3.  Azure App Service

    a.  (Also under the IaS category) Through it we can host web applications in a way that doesn\'t require us to manage underlying infrastructure.

    b.  Allows for hosting API apps AND mobile apps.

    c.  *Even though there are dedicated services in Azure for running containers, you can use Azure App Service to host windows/linux containers*

4.  Serverless Computing (This is also a SET and not an individual service)
