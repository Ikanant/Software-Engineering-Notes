**What is Terraform?**

Terraform is a tool used to automate the deployment of INFRASTRUCTURE across multiple providers across public and private clouds.

-   Infrastructure automation tool

-   Open source and vendor agnostic

-   Single binary compiled from Go

-   Declarative syntax

-   HashiCorp Configuration Language or JSON

-   Push based deployment

Over these notes I will be going over:\
-   Creating a basic configuration and updating it with new resources

-   Understanding Terraform components:

    -   Variables

    -   Provisioners

    -   Providers

    -   Etc

-   Integrating multiple providers

-   Using abstraction and reusable components

    -   Make configurations consistent and repeatable
