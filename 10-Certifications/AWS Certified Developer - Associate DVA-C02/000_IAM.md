Users: End Users - think people

Groups: A collection of users under one set of permissions

Roles: I can create roles and assign them to users/ applications and services to give access to AWS resources. What is important with roles is that you can make sure services have access to other resources within AWS... For example, EC2 instance needs to have access to perform CRUD operations in a DynamoDB... we can set that permission using roles.

Policies (IAM Policy): Document that defines one or more permissions. These policies can be attached to either users/groups/roles. It is possible for user/group/role to all share the same policy.
